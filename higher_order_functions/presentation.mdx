## Introduction

![](./images/real_life_OO.png)


```notes
- literally first picture I came across when googling "OO programming reality"
- Worked in a few legacy codebases in the past
- Very complex, deeply coupled code
- Deep inheritance trees, not a lot of composition
- Mutable state everywhere
- &#x2192; has to be a better way... FP?
```

---

## Functions

<SVG contents={require("./schematics/function_high_level_view.dot")}
     width="75vw"/>

- Data transformations
- For now: assume pure functions
- Composable into larger functions &#x2192; reuse!

```notes
- Used this schematic before in property based testing talk: one of the reasons testing FP code is so easy
- Function can be observed as a black box that applies a transformation to some data
- Purity: no effects (I/O, state updates, ...) visible outside of this function
- All inputs have to be supplied => deterministic!
```

---

## Example function

```javascript
// plus :: (Int, Int) -> Int
const plus = (x, y) => x + y;

const x = plus(1, 2);  // x is now 3!
```

```notes
- Javascript used for examples during this talk
- Added a Haskell type signature (will become more useful later)
- Explain syntax (JS + Haskell) for those not familiar
- Separation of behavior and data
```

---

## Higher order functions

- Functions are data too! &#x2192; "first class" functions
- Variations:
  - Function that takes function(s) as argument
  - Function that returns another function
  - Combination of the above

```notes
- Mention closures
- Something I look for in every new language I pick up
```

---

## Example 1: functions as argument

```javascript
// log :: (String -> String) -> String -> ()
const log = (formatter, message) => {
  const formattedMessage = formatter(message);
  console.log(formattedMessage);
}

log(message => message, "Hello world!");
log(
  message => `${new Date().toISOString()} - ${message}`,
  "Hello world!"
);
```

```notes
- 'log' is here the higher order function
- Takes a formatter function to prettyprint output
```

---

## Example 2: function as return value

```javascript
// isInRange :: (Int, Int) -> (Int -> Bool)
const isInRange = (min, max) => value =>
  min <= value && value <= max;

// inRange :: Int -> Bool
const inRange = isInRange(1, 10);
console.log(inRange(7));  // true
console.log(inRange(11));  // false
```

---

## Why would you want to do this?

- Composable
- Easy to test
- "State" is much more isolated (closures)


```notes
- Reusable, functions all the way down &#x2192; DRY
- Build out your own "language" based on a set of primitives
- Testing: all inputs are explicitly passed in, can be swapped out with simple functions
- Less error prone
```

---

## Relation to design patterns

- All DPs can be created with just functions
- Often more compact/simple &#x2192; easier to maintain

```notes
- Some examples follow on the following slides
```

---

```javascript Command pattern
class LogCommand {
  execute(msg) {
    console.log(msg);
  }
}

const command = new LogCommand();
command.execute(msg);

// vs.

const log = msg => console.log(msg);
log(msg);
----
* > Command pattern
1:8 > OO approach
12:13 > FP approach
```

---

```javascript Decorator pattern
class LogFormatter {
  format(msg) {
    return `${new Date().toISOString()} - ${msg}`
  }
}  // and many other formatters

console.log(new LogFormatter().format(msg));

// vs.

const log = (formatter, message) => {
  const formattedMessage = formatter(message);
  console.log(formattedMessage);
}
----
* > Decorator pattern
1:7 > OO approach
11:14 > FP approach
```

```notes
- Examples may be a bit unfair ;) but very often objects are overkill and not needed at all!
- Only use as much power as you need
- Also: in existing codebases, can combine the two by wrapping formatter in a function!
```

---

### Factory + strategy pattern

```javascript
const calculate = operator => {
  switch (operator) {
    case "+": return (x, y) => x + y;
    case "-": return (x, y) => x - y;
    case "*": return (x, y) => x * y;
    case "/": return (x, y) => x / y;
  }
};

calculate("+")(2, 3)  // 5
calculate("/")(2, 7)  // 0.28
```

```notes
- Factory part: switch statement, returns corresponding function
- Strategy: each function has same signature, performs a different action
- OO approach would build a separate strategy object for each operator
```

---

## Currying

```javascript
// plus :: Int -> Int -> Int
const plus = a => b => a + b;
```

- Transform functions to have only 1 argument at a time
- Some languages do this automatically
- Pro: Uniform structure
- Con: less performance (sometimes)


```notes
- Currying = taking this idea of higher order functions 1 step further
- Simplest example: plus
- Function with 2 args = function with 1 arg that returns another function with 1 arg, that then returns a value
  => Functions with 1 arg are the most powerful
- ->: Right associative, parentheses can be left out
- Uniform structure: more reuse possible
```

---

```javascript Currying examples
[1, 2, 3].map(x => x + 1);  // [2, 3, 4]

// map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
const map = func => array =>
  array.map(func);

// timesTwo :: [Int] -> [Int]
const timesTwo = map(x => x * 2);
timesTwo([1, 2, 3]);  // [2, 4, 6]
----
* > Example: 'map'
1 > Standard map (non-curried)
3:5 > Curried version
7:9 > Using curried map
```

```notes
- Ask who is familiar with map, explain what it does
- Examples: pragmatic approach by reusing existing code
- Leads to all kinds of code reuse (it's again another function)
- Doesnt have to be curried all the way => middleground
```

---

```javascript Currying examples (2)
[1, 2, 3].filter(x => x >= 2);  // [2, 3]

// filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
const filter = func => array =>
  array.filter(func);

const filterEven = filter(x => x % 2 === 0);
filterEven([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]);  // [2, 4, 6]
----
* > Example: 'filter'
1 > Standard filter (non-curried)
3:5 > Curried version
7:8 > Using curried filter
```

---

```javascript Currying examples (3)
[1, 2, 3].reduce((acc, elem) => acc + elem, 0);  // 6

// reduce :: (acc -> elem -> acc) -> acc -> [elem] -> acc
const reduce = func => start => array =>
  array.reduce((acc, elem) => func(acc)(elem), start);

const sum = reduce(x => y => x + y)(0);
sum([1, 2, 3, 4]);  // 10

const product = reduce(x => y => x * y)(1);
product([1, 2, 3, 4]);  // 24
----
* > Example: 'reduce'
1 > Standard reduce (non-curried)
3:5 > Curried version
7:11 > Using curried reduce
```

---

```javascript Currying examples (4)
// identity :: a -> a
const identity = x => x;

// composes from right to left
// compose :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
const compose = b2c => a2b => a => b2c(a2b(a));

// composeMany :: [(a -> a)] -> (a -> a)
const composeMany = reduce(compose)(identity);

// func :: Double -> Double
const func = composeMany([x => x * 2, x => x + 4, x => x / 5]);
map(func)([100, 42, 1337]);  // [48, 24.8, 542.8]
----
* > Going a little crazy
1:2 > "no-op" function
4:6 > Composing functions
8:9 > Composing many functions
11:13 > Using a combined function
```

```notes
- Very quickly you gain a lot of power and expressivity
- Still fairly easy to reason about
- Easily testable!
- Compare this to what you normally write in OO (decorator patterns etc)...
```

---

## Conclusion

- Higher order functions are very versatile and powerful
- Little to no downsides to them (except for learning curve)
- Standard tool in the FP toolkit
