# Talks

This repo contains a collection of talks I have given.
Each talk is located inside a separate folder, separating it from the rest.

## Getting started

1. yarn install
2. yarn present PRESENTATION_FOLDER
3. Open browser and go to http://localhost:8080

`yarn present` will then look for a file `presentation.mdx` to start the presentation from
inside the specified folder and start up a webserver.
