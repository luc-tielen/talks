## A quick recap: unit tests

- Great for checking expected behavior
- But: think out examples manually

---

```javascript
describe("my first unit test", () => {
  it("verifies expected behavior", () => {
    expect(1 + 1).to.eql(2);
  });
})

* > Simple unit test

## A quick recap: unit tests

![Running unit tests](./images/unit_tests.png)

- TODO same slide as previous?

---

## Property based testing

![QuickCheck paper](./images/quickcheck_paper.png)

- Describe behavior of code in terms of "properties"
- Origin: Haskell (QuickCheck)
- Not: exhaustive checking &#x2192; formal verification

---

## Property based testing

- Javascript: [JSverify](https://github.com/jsverify/jsverify) (and others..)
- Side by side with unit tests

---

```javascript
describe("addition", () => {
  property("addition is commutative", "nat", "nat",
    (a, b) => a + b === b + a
  );
});
```

- TODO same slide as previous?

---

## Property based testing

![Running property tests](./images/property_tests.png)

- TODO same slide as previous? or with steps?

---

## High level view

![System under test](./images/high_level_view_sut.png)

- System under test: "SUT"
- Data in, data out

<Notes>
Important, no side effects!
</Notes>

---

## High level view (2)

![Unit test](./images/high_level_view_unit_test.png)

- Single iteration
- Manual created inputs
- Assertions on output

---

## High level view (3)

![Property test](./images/high_level_view_property_test.png)

- Many iterations
- Random data
- Assertions: relations between in- and outputs!

---

## Generators

- "Directed" randomness: e.g. -1, 0, 1, NaN, undefined, unicode, ...
- Library uses generators to automatically create input data

---

## Generators

```javascript
const jsc = require("jsverify");

const arbTime = jsc.record({
  hours: jsc.integer(0, 23),
  minutes: jsc.integer(0, 59),
  seconds: jsc.integer(0, 59)
});

describe("time", () => {
  property(
    "time generator generates valid times",
    arbTime,
    time => true // property that uses random time...
  );
});
```

---

## Generators

![Generators in the REPL](./images/generated_json.png)

```javascript
const jsc = require("jsverify");
const sampler = jsc.sampler(jsc.json, 100);
sampler(20)
```

---

## Shrinking

![Shrinking](./images/shrinking_example.png)

- Failing property: contains random, possibly complex data
- Useful if it would find simpler case

---

## Shrinking (2)

![Shrinking algorithm](./images/shrinking_algorithm.png)

- Repeatedly try with simpler data until test doesn't fail
- &#x2192; previous test is 'minimal' example
- Example: generated a = 125, a < 100

---

## Business logic example

- TODO bank example

---

## "Parallel map" example

- TODO find good counterpart for javascript

---

## Good candidates for PBT

- Business logic (domain layer)
- Pure code in general
- Note: executed many times &#x2192; has to be fast!

---

## Common patterns in PBT

- Commutativity: a + b = b + a
- Associativity: a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
- Idempotency: f(f(x)) = f(x)
- Encode + decode = no-op
- Checking against simplified model
- Checking domain invariants (business rules)
- ...

---

## Testing stateful systems

- Properties so far: no external state across function calls
- TODO check if possible with JSverify
- Out of scope for today

---

## Conclusion

- PBT is a powerful tool in a developers arsenal
- More initial thinking
- Big payoff
- But: not everything is a nail!
