# A little backstory..

- Interested in FP + compilers
- GRIN
- Souffl√©

```notes
My interests in FP + compilers lead me to GRIN, an experimental FP compiler backend.
Internally, they were using Souffl√© for complex analysis of programs and was intrigued.
I investigated Souffl√© and saw that it had a C++ API and started tinkering with it.
Before I knew it I had a working prototype, that called Souffl√© from Haskell via C++ API.
```

---

![Souffle logo](./images/souffle_wide_logo.png)

- Datalog variant
- Great for static analysis, security checks, graph algorithms, ...
- Rapid prototyping and experimentation
- Transpiles to *very* high performance C++

```notes
Datalog is a subset of Prolog (a logic programming language).
Datalog for example does not support ungrounded variables on top level,
limiting expressivity (but does enable some optimizations).
```

---

## An introductory example

- Compute all nodes that are reachable from another

```notes
Think for a moment how you would implement this in your language of choice..
```

```prolog An introductory example
.decl edge(n: symbol, m: symbol)
.decl reachable(n: symbol, m: symbol)

.input edge
.output reachable

edge("a", "b").
edge("c", "d").
edge("d", "e").
edge("e", "f").
edge("f", "g").
edge("d", "h").
edge("h", "g").

reachable(x, y) :- edge(x, y).  // base rule
reachable(x, z) :-              // inductive rule
  edge(x, y),
  reachable(y, z).

1:2 > Predicate types need to be defined up front
4:5 > Predicates need to be marked explicitly as inputs or outputs
7:13 > Facts can be added directly in Souffl√©, or via API.
15:18 > Relations can refer to other facts.
```

```notes
If you forget to mark something as output, the souffle compiler will optimize most generated code away!
Quite a large part of the syntax is already on this slide, Souffl√© is really compact!
"," is a logical conjunction ("and"), ";" is logical disjunction ("or")
Datalog automatically computes the fixpoint of the relations (until no new derived facts are found).
```

```notes
Facts are represented in Haskell as simple product types,
Numbers map to Int32, unsigned to Word32, floats to Float,
symbols to Strings / Text.

You can change type parameter to fetch different relations
Here it requires an annotation since we directly print it
to stdout, but if passed to another function, it can infer
the correct type automatically.
```

## Features

---

### Small core API

- 6 functions + 3 typeclasses
- Very little boilerplate thanks to `GHC.Generics`

```notes
The 6 functions are:
1. runSouffle
2. addFact
3. addFacts
4. run
5. getFacts
6. findFact

(And are all used in previous code snippet.)

The 3 typeclasses are:
1. Program
2. Fact
3. Marshal
```

---

### 2 modes of operation

- Interpreted vs compiled
- Identical API (only change 1 import!)
- &#x2192; Quick development + good performance

---

### Compile time checks

- Based on type level information (via `Program` + `Fact`)
- Custom type errors for better dev experience

TODO show some examples of type errors

---

## Self contained

- No dependency on souffle for transitive dependencies *

# Souffl√© DSL

```notes
Haskell has some features which are really nice for embedded DSLs:

1. Typechecker to prevent certain kinds of mistakes
2. Overloaded literals (integers + strings)
3. Custom operators
```

---

## Thought experiment

- Can we rewrite the following Datalog in Haskell?

```prolog
.decl edge(n: symbol, m: symbol)
.decl reachable(n: symbol, m: symbol)
.input edge
.output reachable

edge("a", "b").
edge("b", "c").

reachable(x, y) :- edge(x, y).
reachable(x, z) :-
  edge(x, y),
  reachable(y, z).
```

---

## Thought experiment

- Type info &#x2192; extract from Haskell types


```prolog
.decl edge(n: symbol, m: symbol)
.decl reachable(n: symbol, m: symbol)
.input edge
.output reachable
```

---

```haskell Thought experiment
data Edge = Edge String String
  deriving (Generic, Marshal, FactMetadata)
data Reachable = Reachable String String
  deriving (Generic, Marshal, FactMetadata)

instance Fact Edge where
  type FactDirection Edge = 'Input
  factName = const "edge"
instance Fact Reachable where
  type FactDirection Reachable = 'Output
  factName = const "reachable"

example = do
  Predicate edge <- predicateFor @Edge
  Predicate reachable <- predicateFor @Reachable
  -- ...
----
1:4 > Define Haskell data types
6:11 > Fact info declared up front using typeclass
13:16 > Generate predicate based on type
```


```notes
- Slightly more verbose, but most of it is already written for normal bindings
- "predicateFor" automatically generates the code, and gives us a handle for writing the logic (see next slide)
```

---

## Thought experiment

- Logic &#x2192; literals + functions + combinators

```prolog
reachable(x, y) :- edge(x, y).
reachable(x, z) :-
  edge(x, y),
  reachable(y, z).
```

---

```haskell Thought experiment
example = do
  Predicate edge <- predicateFor @Edge
  Predicate reachable <- predicateFor @Reachable

  x <- var "x"
  y <- var "y"
  z <- var "z"

  reachable(x, y) |-  -- |- is a synonym for :-
    edge(x, y)
  reachable(x, z) |- do
    edge(x, y)
    reachable(y, z)
----
1:3 > Continuation of previous snippet
5:7 > Manually introduce variables
9:13 > Use predicates to form logical relations
```

```notes
Differences:
- Need to manually introduce variables
- Do syntax for conjunction

NOTE: reachable(x, y) works because reachable is a function that takes a 2-element tuple.
```

---

## Metaprogramming Datalog

```haskell
import Data.List (tails)
import Data.Foldable (traverse_)

pairs :: [a] -> [(a, a)]
pairs l = [(x,y) | (x:ys) <- tails l, y <- ys]
-- pairs [1,2,3] => [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)]

-- TODO: correct type + implementation?
distinctVars :: [Var] -> DSL prog ctx ()
distinctVars vars =
  let varPairs = pairs vars
  in traverse_ (uncurry (.!=)) varPairs

TODO finish + show generated program (+ command?) + afbeelding
```

```notes
This works since a Datalog program is represented by a plain Haskell value.
Metaprogramming becomes simply applying functions to these values to transform entire programs.
```

---

```haskell Metaprogramming Datalog
-- Note: Type signature not required
transitiveVia :: forall prog p1 p2 t. Structure p1 ~ Structure p2
              => Structure p1 ~ '[t, t]
              => Predicate p1 -> Predicate p2 -> DSL prog 'Definition ()
transitiveVia (Predicate p1) (Predicate p2) = do
  a <- var "a"
  b <- var "b"
  c <- var "c"

  p1(a, b) |- p2(a, b)
  p1(a, b) |- do
    p2(a, c)
    p1(c, b)

example :: DSL ExampleProgram 'Definition ()
example = do
  edge <- predicateFor @Edge
  reachable <- predicateFor @Reachable
  reachable `transitiveVia` edge
----
1:4 > Optional type signature
5:13 > Reusable logic as a helper function
15:19 > Using the helper function
```

```notes
Haskell's typesystem automatically gives us "generic" properties for free thanks to typesystem.
In Souffl√©, this required a completely new concept "components" (a.k.a. generics).

Type signature is optional, but helps with type errors. Explicit equality constraints are needed
to make type checker happy.

Should functions like this be added as reusable functions? Separate library?
```

---

## Benefits

- 1 language less in codebase
- DL program is a Haskell value, can be transformed via functions
- More code reuse possible
- Can implement concepts via code generation (distinctVars example)

---

## Limitations

- Only (large) subset of Souffl√© supported
- Not all errors captured in typesystem

```notes
DSL covers most usecases, but feature missing? Use approach with external .dl file!
More errors could be captured via extra semantic analysis pass, or via different design of DSL.
```

# Conclusion

- Powerful synergy of FP + LP
- Still many undiscovered opportunities
- Haskell's type system is amazing!
- Cabal + Haskell + C++ = tricky

```notes
I hope this talk convinced you of the power of combining FP & LP.
There are still many opportunities that can be explored.
Having the typesystem of Haskell made it really easy to enforce certain invariants,
carry around proofs on type level (and still have nice error messages!).
Mixing Haskell with C++ can be quite tricky because of cabal and all the specific compiler flags.
On top of that, there is a lot of OS-specific stuff you need to take into account for C++.
```
