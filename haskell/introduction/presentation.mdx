## Table of contents

- Install party
- Syntax
- Mob / pair programming

```notes
- Pizza somewhere in between ;)
- 3 possible ways to fill the talk:
  1. go over presentation, then coding
  2. first short introduction, then coding, use presentation at home
  3. Somewhere in between
- by no means comprehensive
```

---

## Tooling: projects

- **No** GHC installed globally!
- Better way: [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) (or cabal + nix)
- [hpack](https://github.com/sol/hpack)

---

## Tooling: editor

- My suggestions:
  - [vim](https://github.com/luc-tielen/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/nvim/plugins.vim#L58-L61)
  - emacs
  - VS Code
- Don't go all the way with IDE

```notes
As will be explained later, IDE is not that needed because of REPL and typesystem.
Editor is much more lightweight.
```

---

## Tooling: linting

- [hlint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint)
- Very configurable (see README)

---

## Tooling: packages

- [hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/)
- [stackage](https://www.stackage.org/)
- [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/)
- [hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/)

```notes
- Browse for haskellPackages at https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html
- Hoogle can be run locally (easier if you use nix)
```

---

## Tooling: TDD

- Types, not tests ðŸ¤ª
- `stack build --fast --file-watch`
- Alternative: [ghcid](https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid)
- "Hole driven development"

---

## Tooling: tests

- ... Ok, I lied ðŸ˜‰
- [tasty testing framework](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty)
- [hspec](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hspec)
- [hedgehog](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog) (or [quickcheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck))

```notes
Tasty has plugins for many different types of testing (unit testing, property based, ...)
```

---

## Syntax: high level view

<SVG contents={require("./schematics/module_structure.dot")} width="80%"/>

- Expression / declaration based language
- Every expression has return value (always!)

---

## Syntax: literals

```haskell
1         -- numbers *
3.14      -- fractional numbers *
'a'       -- Char
[1, 2, 3] -- lists
1:2:3:[]  -- lists
"abc123"  -- String = [Char] *
(1, 'b')  -- Tuples
()        -- () type (pronounced 'unit')
```

```notes
Number / Fractional: is a typeclass, will get back to that later
Lists: all elements have to be same type
Tuple: can contain different type per "slot"
String: can also be a typeclass with overloaded syntax
Haskell has 5 string types for very different usecases
Unit: can be compared to void in other languages (everything has a return type)
```

---

## Syntax: assignment + type annotations

```haskell
x :: Int
x = 1234

-- No type annotation required, Haskell has global type inference
y = "abc"

-- Multiple declarations are possible
fib :: Int -> Int
fib 0 = 1
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
```

```notes
- Assignment is immutable, can not be reassigned
- Multiple bindings with different patterns: forms 1 big function declaration
```

---

```haskell Syntax: functions
y = myFancyFunction 1 "abc" -- look Ma, no parens!

-- Lambda syntax ('\\' resembles a 'Î»' with "some" imagination)
myFancyFunction = \\num str -> take num str
-- non-lambda syntax:
myFancyFunctionAlt num str = take num str
-- you could even do this
myFancyFunctionAlt2 = take

-- Important distinction:
f ()       -- function that is applied 1 argument: ()
f (1 + 2)  -- function that is applied 1 argument: (1 + 2)
f (1, 2)   -- function that is applied 1 argument (as a tuple): (1, 2)
f 1 2      -- function that is applied 2 arguments: 1 and 2
-- Might look weird initially, but makes currying seamless!
----
1 > Function application
3:8 > Variations
10:15 > Function application gotchas
```

---

## Syntax: let expressions / where blocks

```haskell
calculation =
  let x = 1
      y = 2
  in x + y

anotherCalc = x + y where
  y = x + 3
  x = 1
```

```notes
- Order of declarations doesn't matter
- Regarding whitespace:
  - as long as indent increases, it's in same block
  - indentation becomes smaller => end of previous block
```

---

```haskell Syntax: conditionals
isZero :: Int -> Bool
isZero 0 = True
isZero _ = False

isZeroWithCase num =
  case num of
    0 -> True
    _ -> False

isZeroWithIf num =
  if num == 0
    then True
    else False

isZeroWithGuard num
  | num == 0 = True
  | otherwise = False

-- This basically creates a lambda (\\x -> x == 0)
isZeroSection = (== 0)
----
1:3 > Pattern matching
5:8 > Case expression
10:13 > If expression
15:17 > Guards
19:20 > Section
```

```notes
Arbritrarily nesting of patterns is possible
If always requires an else (always have to return a value)
```

---

```haskell Syntax: data types
type Name = String

newtype Age = Age Int
  deriving (Eq, Show)

data Dog = Dog Name Age
  deriving (Eq, Show)


dog :: Dog
dog = Dog "Falko" (Age 3)
----
1 > Type synonyms
3:4 > Newtypes
6:7 > Data types
10:11 > Using custom data types
```

```notes
- type: basically a type synonym
- newtype: creates a completely new type from an existing one
  -> for example: not allowed to do + on ages!
  -> no overhead!
- data: creates a new data type, as well as matching constructors
- great for building up your domain
- "crafting with negative space" / "making impossible states impossible"
```

---

```haskell Syntax: data types
data Dog = Dog { dogName :: Name, dogAge :: Age }
  deriving (Eq, Show)

data Tree a = Leaf a
            | Branch (Tree a) (Tree a)

tree :: Tree String
tree = Branch (Leaf "abc")
              (Branch (Leaf "def")
                      (Leaf "ghi"))
----
1:2 > Record syntax
4:5 > Sum / union types
7:10 > Example usage
4[3], 7[5] > Type constructors
4[5, 11], 5[8, 14], 7[7] > Type var replaced with "String"
4[9], 5[3], 8[5, 8], 9[2, 5], 10[2] > Data constructors
```

```notes
- Arbitrary forms of data types are possible!
- Sum types is something that is only recently really picking up steam,
  helps a lot in modeling data so that it can only represent valid states
- Best no record syntax on sum types (leads to partial functions)
```

---

## Syntax: lists

```haskell
-- Comprehensions
x = [x + 1 | x <- [1..10], x > 5]

x' = map (+ 1) (filter (> 5) [1..10])

-- Infinite lists
infiniteUnevens = [1, 3..]
```

---

## Syntax: do notation

```haskell
greetAction :: IO ()
greetAction = do
  print "Hello, what is your name?"
  name <- getLine
  let message = "Hello " ++ name ++ "!"
  print message
```

```notes
- Heavily used in Haskell for 'sequential' computation
- Different syntax, no assignment!
- **A lot** of syntactic sugar is taking place here! (Will be explained in another session)
- Actions, like everything else are lazy => can be composed together to form bigger actions
- Haskell performs no IO directly (runtime does this), you perform IO by equating a value to 'main'
```

---

## Syntax: module / import / exports

```haskell
module Main ( main  -- exports go between the ( and )
            , myHelperFunction
            ) where

import MyOtherModule
-- or: import MyOtherModule ( func1, Dog(..) )
-- ^ imports only certain functions / types

main :: IO ()
main = ...

myHelperFunction = ...
```

---

## Syntax

- Only showed most commonly used features
- Typeclasses left out (focus for next time!)
