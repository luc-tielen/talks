## Introduction

```haskell
length :: [a] -> Int
length [] = 0
length (_:xs) = 1 + length xs

sum :: [a] -> Int
sum = foldl' (+) 0
```

- Haskell: recursion + higher order functions i.s.o. loops
- &#x2192; *less* boilerplate & errors
- Can we reduce this even further?

---

```haskell Factoring out recursion
data Expr = Val Int
          | Var String
          | Sum Expr Expr


data Expr' a = Val a
             | Var String
             | Sum Expr Expr
             deriving Functor

type Expr2 = Expr' Int


data ExprF r = Val Int
             | Var String
             | Sum r r
             deriving Functor
----
1:3 > A simple expression data type
6:11 > Expr can be made a functor
14:17 > Another way Expr can be a functor
14[5], 16[5, 7] > No reference to ExprF in arguments of constructors
```

```notes
Expr' is already more powerful than the first Expr.
It can be used for anything that can be added together.
```

---

## A closer look.. (1)

```haskell
data ExprF r = Val Int
             | Var String
             | Sum r r
             deriving Functor
```

- ExprF describes the structure (pattern) of an expression
- ExprF = `pattern functor`

```notes
The F at the end is a common idiom to indicate that it is a (pattern) functor.
```

---

```haskell A closer look.. (2)
a, b, c :: ExprF Int
a = Val 42
b = Var "x"
c = Sum 21 21

d, e :: ExprF (ExprF Int)
d = Val 1337
e = Sum (Val 1300) (Sum 30 7)

1:4 > 1 layer deep
6:8 > 2 layers deep
```

```notes
Tip: play around with these examples using hole driven development for a better understanding of what's going on.
```

---

## Generalizing this pattern

```haskell
expr :: ExprF (ExprF (ExprF (ExprF (ExprF ...))
```

- `N` levels: `N` occurences of ExprF in type
- Arbitrary amount of levels deep?

---

## Introducing Fix

```haskell
data Fix f = Fix { unfix :: f (Fix f) }
```

- Name origin: *fixpoint* (from math)
- Helps "tying the knot" on type level
- kind Fix = `(Type -> Type) -> Type`

```notes
A fixpoint is when you repeatedly apply a function and the result after each
function application stays the same.
```

---

```haskell Using Fix
data ExprF r = Val' Int
             | Var' String
             | Sum' r r
             deriving Functor

type Expr = Fix ExprF

{-# LANGUAGE PatternSynonyms #-}

pattern Val :: Int -> Expr
pattern Val x = Fix (Val' x)

pattern Var :: String -> Expr
pattern Var x = Fix (Var' x)

pattern Sum :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr
pattern Sum e1 e2 = Fix (Sum' e1 e2)

a, b :: Expr
a = Val 42  -- or: Fix (Val' 42)
b = Sum (Val 10) (Sum (Var "x") (Val 5))
-- or: b = Fix (Sum' (Fix (Val' 10))
--                   (Fix (Sum' (Fix (Var' "x"))
--                              (Fix (Val' 5)))))
----
1:4 > Our earlier defined data type
6 > Tying the knot
8:17 > Synonyms for convenience
19:25 > Expr can be arbitrarily deep now
```

```notes
Tying the knot: Fix and ExprF can interleave each other now, arbitrary amount of levels deep
"Expr" can be arbitrary amount of levels deep thanks to Fix
Instead of pattern synonyms, normal functions could also be used.
PatternSynonyms however also allows pattern matching (unlike functions)
```

---

## Recursion schemes

- Recursive algorithms: divided into groups (= *schemes*)
- Write algorithm from perspective of 1 layer
- Helper functions do all recursion for you

---

## Catamorphisms

```haskell
cata :: Functor f => (f a -> a) -> Fix f -> a
cata alg = alg . fmap (cata alg) . unFix
```

- Reduces recursive structure to single value

```notes
Mnemonic: catastrophe -> break things down.
Also yes, the names used are a little insane.
Recursion works bottom up (leaf nodes first).
Also, you don't need to know the internals to use this function (like with all upcoming schemes)
```

---

## Using cata

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-}

countVars :: Expr -> Int
countVars = cata $ \\case
  Var' _ -> 1
  Sum' count1 count2 -> count1 + count2
  _ -> 0
```

- No recursion in algorithm
- Only pattern match "interesting" cases

---

## Using cata (2)

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-}

data ListF a r = Nil | Cons a r
  deriving Functor

type List a = Fix ListF

length :: List a -> Int
length = cata $ \\case
  Nil -> 0
  Cons _ xs -> 1 + xs
```

```notes
LambdaCase extension: \\case = \\x -> case x of ...
-> 1 less variable to name, less boilerplate
```

---

## Anamorphisms

```haskell
ana :: Functor f => (a -> f a) -> a -> Fix f
ana alg = Fix . fmap (ana alg) . alg
```

- Unfolds a seed value into recursive structure

```notes
Why the name ana? Comes from Greek, means: "building"
```

---

## Using ana

```haskell
list50To1 :: List Int
list50To1 = ana f 50 where
  f 0 = Nil
  f n = Cons n (n - 1)
```

- n - 1 &#x2192; seed for rest of structure

---

## Let's take a step back

```haskell
cata :: Functor f => (f a -> a) -> Fix f -> a
cata alg = alg . fmap (cata alg) . unFix

ana :: Functor f => (a -> f a) -> a -> Fix f
ana alg = Fix . fmap (ana alg) . alg
```

- "Reversed" type signatures
- "Reversed" implementations
- Can we use ana to build data and reduce with cata?

---

## Hylomorphisms

```haskell
hylo :: Functor f => (f b -> b) -> (a -> f a) -> a -> b
hylo f g = cata f . ana g

-- or (more efficiently):
hylo f g = f . fmap (hylo f g) . g
```

- Unfold followed by a fold
- Also called a *refold*
- No fixpoint visible externally

---

## Hylomorphism example

```haskell
sum0ToN :: Int -> Int
sum0ToN = hylo computeSum buildList where
  buildList = \\case
    0 -> Nil
    n -> Cons n (n - 1)
  computeSum = \\case
    Nil -> 0
    Cons n xs -> n + xs
```

```notes
This is a toy example, can be used for things like interpreters (parse = unfold, eval = fold).
```

---

## Effectful folds

- Monadic variants: `cataM`, `anaM`, `hyloM`, ...

```haskell
data InterpretError = UnboundVar String

interpret :: Env -> Expr -> Either InterpretError Int
interpret env = runExcept $ cataM $ \\case
  Val' value -> pure value
  Var' var -> do
    case Map.lookup var env of
      Nothing -> throwError $ UnboundVar var
      Just value -> pure value
  Sum' e1 e2 -> liftA2 (+) e1 e2
```

```notes
No need for Reader monad like we did before in a previous talk.
No threading of environment is needed through the code since we are thinking on the level of a single layer.
It might be convenient to reintroduce it if the env will be passed to many other helper functions though.
```

---

## Even more variations

- para, apo, histo, futu, chrono, ...
- Start from your usecase, figure out which is most appropriate
- [recursion-schemes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/recursion-schemes) provides all these functions

---

## Final notes on recursion schemes

- Actual library on Hackage goes much, *much* further
- Generalizes all recursion schemes to just 3 functions
- Uses Template Haskell to generate pattern functor definitions

---

## Conclusion

- Recursion schemes: write algorithm without manual recursion
- Much less boilerplate & errors
- Limited to specific form of ADT (no mutual recursion)
- Added mental overhead

```notes
Mutual recursion is handled by other libraries such as multirec for example.
These libraries however require a lot more type level programming than with the single ADT approach used here.
```
