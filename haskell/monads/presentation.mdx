## Introduction

- 2nd last time: Functors
- Last time: Applicative Functors
- Today: Monads

---

## Quick recap: Functors

```haskell
fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> (f a -> f b)
```

- map: *upgrades* function of 1 arg

---

## Quick recap: Applicative functors

```haskell
pure :: Applicative f => a -> f a
(<*>) :: Applicative f => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

- pure: *wraps* argument in a context
- (<\*>): Composes expressions in a context

---

```haskell Another common pattern in code
data MyType = ...

doStuff :: MyType -> Maybe MyType

maybeDoStuff :: Maybe MyType -> Maybe MyType
maybeDoStuff m = case m of
  Nothing -> Nothing
  Just value ->
    case doStuff value of  -- some more code
      Nothing -> Nothing
      Just value2 -> Just value2
----
* > Example with Maybe
1,3 > Code defined elsewhere
6[7:11] > First do a pattern match
7 > Abort on Nothing
8:11 > Do stuff with value inside Maybe
11 > Can have many nested cases (with a lot of boilerplate)
```

---

```haskell Example with Either
data MyType = ...
data MyError = ...

doStuff :: MyType -> Either MyError MyType

eitherDoStuff :: Either MyError MyError -> Either MyError MyType
eitherDoStuff m = case m of
  Left err -> Left err
  Right value ->
    case doStuff value of
      Left err -> Left err
      Right value2 -> Right value2
----
* > Another example
8[1,7], 9[1], 11[1,7], 12[1,7] > Only differences
```

```notes
Allows dealing with Eithers in a safe, but boilerplatey way.
```

---

## Some observations

- Not composable
- A lot of boilerplate needed
- Clearly, there must be a better way

---

```haskell Let's refactor some code
doStuff :: MyType -> Maybe MyType

maybeDoStuff :: Maybe MyType -> Maybe MyType
maybeDoStuff m = case m of
  Nothing -> Nothing
  Just value -> doStuff value



maybeDoStuff :: Maybe MyType -> (MyType -> Maybe MyType) -> Maybe MyType
maybeDoStuff m f = case m of
  Nothing -> Nothing
  Just value -> f value



maybeDoStuff :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
maybeDoStuff m f = case m of
  Nothing -> Nothing
  Just value -> f value



andThenMaybe :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
andThenMaybe m f = case m of
  Nothing -> Nothing
  Just value -> f value
----
1:6 > Initial code
1, 6[7] > This can be explicitly passed in
10:13 > Can now be used with many more functions
10[7, 12, 18, 25] > This can be generalized
17:20 > a doesn't have to equal b, allows more places to use this function
17[1] > Name can be made more general now too
24:27 > Final result
```

---

## Lets refactor some code

- Same refactor possible for many data types

```haskell
andThenEither :: Either e a -> (a -> Either e b) -> Either e b
andThenEither m f = case m of
  Left err -> Left err
  Right value -> f value
```

---

## Let's take a step back

- Can we generalize this?

```haskell
andThenMaybe  :: Maybe    a -> (a -> Maybe    b) -> Maybe    b
andThenEither :: Either e a -> (a -> Either e b) -> Either e b
andThenIO     :: IO       a -> (a -> IO       b) -> IO       b
```

---

```haskell Monad typeclass
class Applicative m => Monad (m :: Type -> Type) where
  (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
  (>>) :: m a -> m b -> m b
  return :: a -> m a
  fail :: String -> m a
  {-# MINIMAL (>>=) #-}
----
* > Typeclass definition
2,6 > a.k.a. andThen / bind / flatMap in other languages
3 > Same as (*>) from Applicative ("soon" deprecated)
4 > Same as pure from Applicative ("soon" deprecated)
5 > Function moved to other typeclass since GHC8.8
```

```notes
Quite some legacy due to historic reasons, gradually is being phased out.
Migrations of code between version are often fairly trivial due to static typing.
```

---

## First Monad instances

```haskell
instance Monad Maybe where
  (>>=) = andThenMaybe

instance Monad Either where
  (>>=) = andThenEither

instance Monad IO where
  (>>=) = _ -- requires use of RTS internals

instance Monad Identity where
  (Identity a) >>= f = f a

-- Also try out ":i Monad" in REPL
```

```notes
RTS stands for the (Haskell) runtime system
```

---

## A different perspective

```haskell
(>>=) :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
```

- Everything **not** known 'statically' up front
- We have to evaluate **m a** first
- Explicit ordering of actions
- &#x2192; less optimizations possible

---

```haskell A different perspective
(<*>) :: Applicative f => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

(=<<) :: Monad       m => (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b

-- Note: (=<<) = flip (>>=)
----
* > Applicative vs Monad
1[12:20], 3[13:21] > Main difference
```

---

```haskell A note on do-syntax
action = do
  putStr "Hello"
  putStr "world!"
  putStr "\\n"

action =
  putStr "Hello" >>
  putStr "world!" >>
  putStr "\\n"


action' = do
  x1 <- action1
  x2 <- action2 42
  action3 x1 x2

action' =
  action1
    >>= (\\x1 -> action2 42
      >>= (\\x2 -> action3 x1 x2))
----
1:9 > desugaring to ">>"
12:20 > desugaring to ">>="
```

---

## A note on do-syntax

- do-syntax is syntax sugar
- Polymorphic (only requires Monad constraint)
- Cleans monadic code up a lot

---

```haskell Some examples
newtype Name = Name Text
newtype Age = Age Int
data Dog = Dog Name Age

validateName :: Text -> Maybe Name
validateAge :: Int -> Maybe Age


-- What can the following examples return?

example1 :: Text -> Int -> Maybe Dog
example1 nameText years = do
  name <- validateName nameText
  age <- validateYears years
  pure $ Dog name age


example2 :: Monad m => m Int
example2 = do
  -- some more code...
  pure 42

## Using monads to represent effects

- [Reader](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-Reader.html): Read-only state
- [Writer](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-Writer-Lazy.html): Write-only state
- [State](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-State-Lazy.html): Read + write state
- [Except (Either)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-Except.html): Error handling
- ... and many more

---

## Using monads to represent effects

- "Plumbing"
- Functions for specific functionality
- Functions for extracting result values from the monadic action
- Effects are contained (pure to the outside world)
- Custom effects built out of other effects

---

```haskell Examples
-- State: s -> a -> (s, a)

type Counter a = State Int a

increment :: Counter ()
increment = modify (+1)

increment' :: Counter ()
increment' = do
  current <- get
  put $ current + 1

evalCounter :: Int -> Counter a -> Int
evalCounter start counter = execState counter start

three :: Int
three = evalCounter 0 $ do
  increment
  increment
  increment
----
1 > Representation of state
3 > Type synonym for convenience
5:6 > Monadic helper function
8:11 > Alternate implementation
13:14 > Extracting a counter value
16:20 > Computing a value
```

---

```haskell Examples
data NumberError = NegativeValue Int | DivideByZero

someFunc :: Int -> Either NumberError Int
someFunc x = do
  when (x < 0) $ throwError $ NegativeValue x
  pure $ x + 1

example :: Int -> Int -> Either NumberError Int
example a b = do
  a' <- someFunc a
  b' <- someFunc b
  when (b' == 0) $ throwError DivideByZero
  pure $ div a' b'
----
1 > An error type for all possible errors in our usecase
3:6 > A function that might throw errors
8:13 > Composition of monadic functions
```

```notes
Error handling done automatically due to Either monad
```

---

```haskell Examples
data Expr = Var String
          | Add Expr Expr
          | Mul Expr Expr
          -- ...

type Env = Map String Int

interpret1 :: Env -> Expr -> Int
interpret1 env e = case e of
  Var x -> case Map.lookup x env of
    Nothing -> _ -- Q: how to handle this properly?
    Just value -> value
  Add e1 e2 -> interpret1 env e1 + interpret1 env e2
  Mul e1 e2 -> interpret1 env e1 * interpret1 env e2


interpret2 :: Env -> Expr -> Int
interpret2 env e = runReader (go e) env where
  go :: Expr -> Reader Env Int
  go e = case e of
    Var x -> do
      env <- ask
      case Map.lookup x env of
        Nothing -> _ -- Q: how to handle this properly?
        Just value -> pure value
    Add e1 e2 -> (+) <$> go e1 <*> go e2
    Mul e1 e2 -> (*) <$> go e1 <*> go e2


data InterpretError = VarNotFound String

interpret3 :: Env -> Expr -> Either InterpretError Int
interpret3 env e = runExcept $ runReaderT (go e) env where
  go e = case e of
    Var x -> do
      env <- ask
      case Map.lookup x env of
        Nothing -> throwError $ VarNotFound x
        Just value -> pure value
    Add e1 e2 -> (+) <$> go e1 <*> go e2
    Mul e1 e2 -> (*) <$> go e1 <*> go e2
----
1:14 > First way of evaluating an expression
10[9:15] > Only place we actually need the environment
13[11,19], 14[11,19] > But have to pass env everywhere
17:27 > Second way of evaluating
30:41 > And now with error handling
```

```notes
- This is actually a monad transformer (combination of 2+ monadic effects)
- TODO check if last snippet is correct, didn't typecheck it
```

---

## Using monads to represent effects

- Allows sequencing of expressions
- Forces an explicit evaluation order, with a certain *effect*
- Imperative concepts can be mapped onto Monads
- "Programmable semicolon"

---

## Examples in the ecosystem

- [mtl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl)
- [megaparsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec)
- [async](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/async)
- [monad-par](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-par)
- ... (pretty much most libraries on hackage)

---

## Monad laws

1. Functor laws must hold
2. Applicative laws must hold
3. `Left identity`: pure a >>= f = f a
4. `Right identity`: m >>= pure = m
5. `Associativity`: (m >=> f) >=> g = m >=> (g >=> h)

---

## Conclusion

- Monads: powerful concept, based on simple core idea
- Allows Haskell to perform IO
- Support for first class effects
- Do syntax: clean way of writing effectful code
- Haskell: the best imperative language? 😂

---

## Next time

- BF interpreter

```notes
Interpreter forms a good showcase of examples from last time
Also will be our full-fledged Haskell program
Allows gradually introducing more advanced concepts
```
