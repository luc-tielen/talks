```haskell
quicksort [] = []
quicksort (x:xs) = quicksort smaller ++ [x] ++ quicksort larger
  where smaller = [y | y <- xs, y <= x]
        larger  = [y | y <- xs, y > x]
```

```notes
- quick recap from last time:
  - showed some basic syntax and examples
  - explained ecosystem a little bit
```

- Exercises

```notes
- Not much new things today, first want to focus on exercises since didn't get around to that last time
- Focus on typeclasses since they appear everywhere in Haskell
```

---

## Polymorphism

- "A value is polymorphic if there is more than one type it can have."
- Haskell:
  - only way of code reuse
  - key feature of type system
- Other languages: "generics"


```haskell
func1 :: Bool -> Bool

func2 :: Char -> Char

func3 :: a -> a
```

```notes
Examples will be revisited in a later slide
```

---

## Modes of programming

1. Very concrete/specific types
2. Ultra-generic types
3. Somewhere in between (typeclasses)

```notes
In practice, the 3 modes can be interleaved really easily
```

---

### 1. Concrete types

- No (or little) reuse of functions
- Great for code in specific situations
- Example: domain logic

```haskell
computeTotalPrice :: ShoppingCart -> Money
```

---

### 2. Ultra generic types

- Types containing type variables
- **Completely opaque** &#x2192; can only pass the value around
- Example: "code plumbing" or "connect the dots"

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
```

```notes
- Type var is completely opaque, we know nothing about it!
- Only way map can work is if it is applied to each element of input list.
```

---

### 3. Typeclasses

- Sometimes, you don't want complete opaque data
- What if we could require only certain properties of our data?
- (a.k.a. "traits" / "open interfaces" in other languages)

---

```haskell 3. Typeclasses (examples)
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  -- The real Eq definition provides default implementations here too,
  -- often only have to implement ==, and get /= for free!

-- Now we can make instances for all types that can be checked for equality
instance Eq Bool where
  True == True = True
  False == False = True
  _ == _ = False

instance Eq Dog where
  (Dog name1 age1) == (Dog name2 age2) =
    name1 == name2 && age1 == age2
  -- Name and Age have to implement Eq too, otherwise type error!

-- etc.

7:11 > Implementation for booleans
13:19 > (Naive ðŸ˜…) implementation for dogs
```

```notes
- Definition literally copied from Haskell (:i Eq in REPL)
- ADTs + typeclasses form a really structured way of composing behavior together
- We can extend functionality of existing data types
- Inside the instance, we know which type it is, so we can be more specific!
```

---

### 3. Typeclasses (in functions)

- New syntax: **=>**
- Everything before '=>' is a (typeclass) constraint
- Extensible: supports each type that implements typeclass

```haskell
print :: Show a => a -> IO ()

(==) :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool
```

---

```haskell 3. Typeclasses (Superclasses)
class Eq a => Ord a where
  compare :: a -> a -> Ordering
  (<) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (<=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (>) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (>=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  max :: a -> a -> a
  min :: a -> a -> a
  {-# MINIMAL compare | (<=) #-}

-- Note: Eq a does not show up here, since it is implied by Ord
(<=) :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool
----
* > Ord (ordering) example
1[2:10], 4, 6 > 'Ord a' requires 'Eq a' (in general)
11:12 > Full type signature of <=
```

```notes
- Definition: '-i Ord' in GHCi
- Not going too much into detail now, but just now it is there
- "For something be orderable, it first needs to be comparable"
```

---

## 3. Typeclasses (deriving)

```haskell
data Dog = Dog Name Age
  deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)
```

- Compiler can generate (sensible) default code
- By default: Show, Eq, Ord, Read, Bounded, Enum, Ix
- Others: requires language extension

---

## Final note on parametricity

- How many ways to implement the following functions?
- Give other possible names for these functions

```haskell
??? :: Bool -> Bool

??? :: String -> String

??? :: a -> a

??? :: Show a => a -> IO ()
```

&#x2192; Type signatures contain a lot of information!

```notes
function1: identity, not, xor
function2: identity, or modifyString
function3: identity
function4: print (but could also be launchMissiles, or anything that performs IO!)

Less amount of possibilities is important because then there are less ways
to implement a function &#x2192; less chance of bugs!
Less posbilities also makes it easier to reason about code

Only be as specific as you need to be &#x2192; most opportunity for reasoning
```

---

## Conclusion

- Typeclasses and generic functions are great for reusable code
- Haskell offers fine grained control of limiting possibilities in functions
- By limiting possibilities, we can reason a lot more about code

---

## Next time...

- Semigroups
- Monoids
- Foldable (/ Traversable)
- More exercises?

---

## Mob / pair programming

- Download and unpack this [tarball](https://github.com/luc-tielen/talks/blob/master/haskell/introduction/example_project/introduction-to-haskell.tar.gz)
- Common stack commands: see Makefile
- Short exercises: `make repl`
- Longer exercises: add to Main.hs & `make test`

- Form small groups (2-3 people?)
- Good luck! ðŸ˜‰

```notes
- :? for possible commands in REPL
```

## Warming up: Hole driven development

- Let compiler fill in the gaps
- Useful for both generic and specific code
- Programmer decides on "useful" solution
- Showcase with some examples:
  - map
  - head of list
  - Eq instance for "Maybe a"

---

## Exercises (2)

- Insert an element into list at specific index
