## What is category theory?

- Abstract branch of mathematics
- Explains how math works (e.g. "+")
- Mathematicians often question it's usefulness
- But... a **goldmine** for programmers!

---

## Why category theory?

- Modeling your problem in a very general way
- Has been reasoned about for hundreds of years
- Based on well-founded principles (mathematical laws) => properties
- Super-composable!
- TODO: figure of puzzle vs lego

---

## Today

- An appetizer for Haskell & category theory
- Examples along the way to clarify
- Most commonly used concepts
- And a taste of some more exotic ones...

---

## Haskell

- Purely functional, statically typed programming language
- Heavily based on category theory
- Very rigorous in what is allowed in a function

---

```haskell Functions
identity :: a -> a
identity a = a

plus :: Int -> Int -> Int
plus a b = a + b
```

---

```haskell Algebraic data types
data Bool where
  True :: Bool
  False :: Bool

data List a where
  Cons :: a -> List a -> List a
  Nil  :: List a
```

---

```haskell Typeclasses
class Show a where
  show :: a -> String

class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (!=) :: a -> a -> Bool
```

---

## Semigroup

- Associative binary operation

---

## Monoid

- Semigroup
- Neutral element

---

## Monoid examples

- Integers (twice): +; *
- Bools (twice): and / or
- Lists
- Products of monoids
- Sums of monoids
- Functions returning monoids
- ...

---

## Functor

- Structure preserving mapping operation

---

## Applicative

- Functor
- "Inject operation" (pure)
- "Apply operation"

---

## Monad

- Applicative
- "And then" operation
- Notoriously infamous

---

## Monad (2)

- Maybe / Optional
- Either / Result
- Promise
- IO
- ...

---

## And much more...

- Groups
- Categories
- Comonads
- Arrows
- Lattices
- Semirings
- ...

---

## And even more...

- Denotational design
- Equational reasoning
- ...

---

## One last example

- TODO

---

## Conclusion

- Can be used to model complex models in a general way
- Difficult to initially get into
- But definitely worth the effort!
